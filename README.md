# Website
I created this website while taking an online web development course, Udemy's 2020 Web Development Bootcamp. Instructor: Angela

The website showcases what I learnt from the course. The implementation of the navigation bar was not part of the course and is something I implemented on my own.
The contact.html is a dummy page to test the navigation bar.
